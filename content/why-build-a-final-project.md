# The Final Project

Every intensive course or bootcamp we do at 4Geeks requires the students to build a final project.

## Solidify skills learned

We know the course is very fast paced, when you get to the final project you will feel that you are not ready for it, that you don't know how to start.

## Showcasing your abilities

A final project can serve as a portfolio piece to showcase your abilities to potential employers or clients. It demonstrates your problem-solving skills, creativity, and ability to work on a large-scale project.

## Developing collaboration skills

Building a final project typically involves working in a team, which can help you develop collaboration and communication skills that are valuable in any work environment.

## Building confidence

Successfully completing a final project can boost your confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment. This can motivate you to continue learning and pursuing your career goals.
