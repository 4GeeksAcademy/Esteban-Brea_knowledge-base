# Cybersecurity Virtual Machines

Aside from the publicly known [virtual machines to practice cybersecurity](https://4geeks.com/lesson/virtual-machines-for-cybersecurity) we have prepared an additional list of computers that are ideal for learning CyberSecurity:

## Debian Virtual Machine

We have prepared a machine with Debian installed, with some basic settings that will be used during the bootcamp.  
Otherwise, it is a regular Debian machine like any other, and it will be an important space where you'll learn how to use GNU/Linux systems securely for its use in network environments as a server.

### Installing the Debian Virtual Machine

Depending on your operating system:

A) Windows and Linux computers can [download the OVA file](https://storage.googleapis.com/breathecode/virtualbox/deb.ova) and must import it to VirtualBox to create the Debian virtual machine. It is a heavy file, so it is advisable to download it in advance to save time when doing the practice.  

B) Mac computers can download the ISO file (heavier) and use UTM to `emulate` (not virtualize) the machine.
