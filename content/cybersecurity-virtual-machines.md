## Debian Virtual Machine

We have prepared a machine that comes with Debian installed and it has some basic settings that will be used along the bootcamp. 
Otherwise, it is a regular Debian machine like any other, and it will be an important space where you'll learn how to use GNU/Linux systems securely for its use in network environments as a server.

### Installing the Debian Virtual Machine

Depending on your operating system:

A) Windows and Linux computers can [download the OVA file](https://storage.googleapis.com/breathecode/virtualbox/deb.ova) and must import to VirtualBox to create de Debian virtual machine. It is a heavy file, so it is advisable to download it in advance to save time when doing the practice.
B) Mac computers can download the ISO file (heavier) and use UTM to `emulate` (not virtualize) the machine.
