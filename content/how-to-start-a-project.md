# How to start a coding project

At 4Geeks we understand that starting a project is one of the hardest things to do. There are many ways to start coding a new project, so many that it is tough to know the best or the "recommended way". 

After a lot of hard work, we came up with the following alternatives; please read carefully and choose the best that fits your needs:

## 1) What Github repository are you trying to open?

The most critical step is recognizing which repository you want to open; there are two options:
- Some projects require starting from scratch but using one of 4Geek's templates.
- Other projects come with pre-written code; you need to fork and clone the project's principal repository before opening it.

Ensure you understand the URL of the repository you need to open.

## 2) Opening the repository

Once you know precisely the repository you need to open, navigate to that repository and open it using **only one** of the following ways:

- Using a cloud computer on Codespaces (recommended).
- Using a cloud computer on Gitpod.
- Working on your local machine.

### If you are using Codespaces (takes 10 seconds)

Currently, this is recommended way to open the repo.

Once you navigate to the repository page, you will find a green button that says `Code`, here is [a screenshot that shows how the button should display on the top of the repository](https://github.com/breatheco-de/content/raw/master/src/assets/images/open-codespace.png) and here is an [animated gif with the steps to open it](https://github.com/breatheco-de/content/raw/master/src/assets/images/create-codespace.gif?raw=true)

> üíª Note: here are more details about [opening repositories with Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-github-codespaces).

### If you are using Gitpod (for legacy users)

Please download the Gitpod extension [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) or [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gitpod/).

Once you navigate to the repository page, you will find a green button that says `Gitpod`, here is [a screenshot that shows how the button should display on the repository](https://storage.googleapis.com/breathecode-asset-images/15d7c805161244a5a38d7bbf82fb8d355073ad7ac195088a453fba5777c3ef99.png). Press the button and the project will start opening immediately.

### If you are working locally on your computer

We don't recommend working on your local computer, but here are the instructions if you insist. 

You can find very detailed explanations [on this article](https://4geeks.com/how-to/github-clone-repository), but here is a summary:

- Make sure you have git installed.
- Find your computer terminal or power shell (for windows).
- Navigate to the folder you want to download the files using the `cd` command.
- Run the following command that will download the code:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
````
- Once the project has finished downloading, you can open the VSCode editor in that folder, usually by typing `$ code .` on your terminal (notice the dot `.` at the end. If that command does not work, you can still open VSCode, click on "open folder" and find your project folder.
