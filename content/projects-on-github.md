# The Importance of Making Your Projects Public on GitHub

Projects are absolutely crucial because they represent work that will become a part of your portfolio. These projects not only showcase your skills as a programmer but also serve as a powerful tool to demonstrate what you are capable of achieving in the professional field. They are like your introduction to potential employers or clients.

For this reason, it is ESSENTIAL that you read this article because we do not want you to miss the opportunity to save your projects.

## ðŸš« Deletion of Projects upon Graduation ðŸš«

**Here comes the crucial part**: When you graduate from 4Geeks, the projects you have created in our programs will be **deleted** if you have not configured them as **public repositories** on GitHub. This deletion is part of our data cleaning process and cannot be **reversed**.

We understand that there is a possibility that you may prefer to keep some projects private. That is a completely valid choice, but it is important that you understand the implications. If you decide to keep your projects as **private repositories**, please note that you will lose access to them.

## How to Make Your Projects Public

If you have not worked with GitHub yet or are not sure how to make your projects public, do not worry. Just make sure to do the following:

### Action Required

- Fork each of your repositories: By forking, you will create a copy under your personal GitHub account, becoming the sole owner.

### Steps:

1. Log in to your GitHub account.

2. Visit the repository you want to fork (for example, `https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/<Your-Repository>`).

> Note: You should replace `<your-repository>` with the actual name of your repository.

3. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner.

4. Find your forked repository at `https://github.com/<Your-Username>/<Your-Repository>`.

> Note: You should replace `<Your-Username>` and `<your-repository>` with your actual username and repository name.

Making your projects **public** on GitHub is essential for your success both during and after your time at 4Geeks. We encourage you to consider this decision carefully and make the most of this opportunity to showcase your work and learn from the developer community!
