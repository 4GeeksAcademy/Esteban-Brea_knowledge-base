LearnPack is a powerful tool designed to enhance your learning experience and make your programming practice way smoother! It is the result of dedicated efforts aimed at streamlining the learning process here at 4Geeks. We know that [effective learning](https://4geeks.com/mastering-technical-knowledge) goes beyond just theory - it's about practice, engagement, and hands-on experience. That's why LearnPack has been crafted to bring you a seamless and productive learning journey.

When you're enrolled in one of our programs, you'll find a treasure trove of practice exercises waiting for you within your modules. These exercises are thoughtfully designed to reinforce your understanding and sharpen your programming skills. It's not just about learning concepts; it's about actively applying them.

So what exactly is LearnPack? LearnPack is a tool for creating interactive tutorials with automated tests without needing any configuration. LearnPack is used for step-by-step tutorials for building a project or for tutorials on a technology that has multiple isolated exercises (that do not depend on each other), with automated tests.

### Start LearnPack

When you're in your program, you'll find practice exercises in your modules. When you open them, at the top of the screen, you'll see a blue box that looks like this:

After you click the **Start New Exercise** button, another screen will pop up where you can set up your workspace. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see a green button that says **Create codespace** to make it.

One great thing about learnPack is that it comes included with the code editor! You don't have to worry about starting it elsewhere. Once you open your codespace, LearnPack will start automatically, showing you the instructions on the right side of the screen.

> If for some reason LearnPack doesn't start, you just have to type in the terminal `learnpack start`

### LearnPack Functions

LearnPack does more than just give you instructions during exercises. It's super useful in many ways! Right at the top of the instructions, there's a menu where you can find different things:

- 📖 **Menu:** A menu will pop down if you click on the three bars in the top left corner. It has all the exercises sorted by sections, which helps you find them quickly.

- 📦 **Build:** We can say that 'build' is basically for compiling the code and seeing what happens when it runs. This result can show up in the terminal or as a new page, depending on the exercise's programming language. It's like watching your code come to life!

- 🎓 **Tutorials:** Give it a shot first when you're stuck. Research and look closely at your code. If you still can't figure it out, we've got your back with video tutorials. Just click on the graduation cap icon, and it'll open the tutorial that will guide you through the exercise step by step.

- ☑️ **Test:** After completing your code, click on the checkmark icon to test it. This ensures no errors, allowing you to move on to the next exercises!

- 🗣️ **Language:** Where you see the flag icon, you can switch languages! We suggest choosing your native language or the one you're most comfortable with. This way, you'll understand the instructions better.

- 🐞 **Report bugs:** Your feedback greatly benefits us! We're committed to making your learning experience the best it can be. If you notice something isn't working quite right or could be better, just click on the bug symbol and describe the problem you found. Our team will take a look and make the needed improvements. Your input helps us make things even better for everyone!

- ❔ **Help button:** Here, you'll find a list of Frequently Asked Questions that could clear up any question you might have. Take a look, as someone else might have had the same question, and you'll find the answer already provided!
