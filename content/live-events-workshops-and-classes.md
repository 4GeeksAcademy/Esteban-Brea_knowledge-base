# 4Geeks.com Live Events, Workshops & Classes

Commonly students have problems creating projects, getting stuck in part of the process. A space to ask questions and watch how it should be done, helps a student to implement good practices and to get unstuck.

Live Events are important because they help students overcome technical or career challenges in real-time. This allows participants to receive guidance and support from experienced professionals, which can help them to overcome obstacles that they might not be able to solve on their own.
