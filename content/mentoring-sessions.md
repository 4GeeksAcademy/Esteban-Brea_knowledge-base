Many studies have proven that mentorship sessions are the most efficient method to speed up learning technical skills. Research in various educational contexts consistently highlights the profound impact of mentorship. For instance, a systematic review found that mentoring significantly enhances professional identity formation by providing both emotional and instrumental support, thereby boosting confidence and self-efficacy in menteesâ€‹ ([BioMed Central](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-022-03589-z))â€‹. Similarly, studies in STEM education have shown that mentored students develop a stronger scientific identity, linking them to essential career resources and research opportunitiesâ€‹ ([SpringerOpen](https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-020-00242-3))â€‹.

<quote>At 4Geeks Academy, we take [mentorship](https://4geeks.com/mentorships) very seriously and have tailored the whole learning experience around it.  -- Alejandro Sanchez</quote>

We believe that personalized guidance is key to mastering technical skills efficiently. Depending on the learning plan, students can choose from specific or unlimited 1-1 mentorship sessions and group mentorship options. This flexibility ensures that each student receives the support they need to thrive in their learning journey.

## Our mentors are experts

All of our mentors are experts in the syllabus they are mentoring. They have previously completed all or most of the projects the students work on, ensuring they can provide relevant, hands-on advice and solutions. This direct experience with the coursework enables our mentors to guide students through challenges effectively and share insights from their professional journeys.

## Our mentors are availabile

We are proud of our extensive network of mentors. With dozens of mentors distributed around the world, students always have access to the help they need without having to wait for several days. Our global presence also means that mentorship sessions can be adapted to the student's timezone, providing maximum convenience and support.

That's why we've ensured you can have these mentoring sessions whenever suits you best. We want your learning experience to be as convenient as possible, so you can focus on growing and killing it out there!

## How many 1-on-1 mentorships do you have available?

Depending on your program, you may have mentorships ranging from 0 to unlimited. Sometimes the number of mentorships automatically resets every month, and you get more, or sometimes, they don't reset on their own, and you may have to buy more if needed.

You can find out how many mentorship sessions you have by clicking the following link, which will take you to [your profile subscriptions summary](https://4geeks.com/profile/subscriptions).

If you don't see any box referring to the number of mentorships available, it probably means that you have unlimited, but you can always check with our  support team by sending an email to support@4geeks.com or speaking with your program manager.
