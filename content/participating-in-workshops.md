Don't hesitate to ask questions during sessions. These workshops are designed for your learning, to help you understand, clarify, and put new things into practice. So, if anything is unclear or confusing, speak up and ask those questions. We're all here to support each other and become better programmers together. No doubts should be left behind!

### 3) Take Notes üìù
In the workshops, the pros will share lots of tips and make important comments. You'll learn a ton from them. So, it's a good idea to have a pencil and paper handy; write down anything you find important. This way, you'll remember the info better and have a helpful reference when you practice coding on your own!

### 4) Hands-On Practice üí™
After the workshops, don't forget to practice what you've learned on your own. It's super important to reinforce all that newfound knowledge through hands-on practice. Trust me, doing it right away is way easier than putting it off for later. Small details can slip from your memory, and we don't want that, because they can make a big difference in your coding journey. So, let's keep that momentum going and make sure those skills stick like glue. 

### 5) Networking üåê
Let's talk about networking, it's a fantastic way to boost your learning experience. Try connecting with people in the workshop, who share the same interests and learning goals as you. You'll get to share ideas, learn from different perspectives, and grow together. It's a great way to expand your knowledge and make new coding mates.

### 6) You've Got This üî•
Trust yourself! We're all here to learn together. So, don't worry about making mistakes or asking what you might think is a "silly question." There's no judgment, seriously! The most important thing is to have confidence in yourself and your abilities. Trust in what you do, that is the key to really success.
